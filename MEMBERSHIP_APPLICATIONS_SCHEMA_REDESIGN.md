## Relationships & Dependencies

### Foreign Keys
- `household_id` → Households (N:1, nullable until approved)
- `sponsor_email` → Can reference Individuals or external email
- `assigned_to` → Can reference Individuals (board members)
- `reviewed_by` → Can reference Individuals (board members)

### One-to-One (After Approval)
- When application is approved:
  1. Create new Household record
  2. Set `household_id` in Membership Applications
  3. Set Household `application_status` = "Approved"
  4. Set Household `approved_date` = application `approved_date`
  5. Set Household `approved_by` = application `reviewed_by`
  6. Create Individuals record for primary applicant (with email from `primary_applicant_email`)

### Audit Trail
- Membership Applications serves as complete record of application lifecycle
- Audit Log captures state changes (submitted, assigned, approved, denied, etc.)

---

## Data Validation Rules

### Before Approval
- `status` cannot be "Approved" or "Denied" without `reviewed_by` and `review_date`
- `assigned_to` must be a valid board member email
- `membership_category` must match one of: Full, Affiliate, Associate, Diplomatic, Community, Temporary
- If `membership_category` requires sponsor (Affiliate, Associate, etc.):
  - `sponsor_name` is required
  - `sponsor_email` is required
  - `sponsor_verified` is required before approval

### Upon Approval
- `household_id` must be populated
- `dues_amount` must be calculated from membership level
- `membership_start_date` typically = `approved_date`
- `membership_expiration_date` = `membership_start_date` + 1 year
- New Household record auto-created (via Apps Script trigger)
- Primary applicant becomes Primary member in new household

### Upon Denial
- `denial_reason` is required
- `status` = "Denied"
- `reviewed_by` and `review_date` required
- No household record created
- No Individuals record created

## Integration with Households Sheet

When application is approved, Apps Script automatically:

1. **Create new Household record:**
   - Generate `household_id`
   - Set `primary_member_id` (to primary applicant individual_id)
   - Set `household_name` (from primary applicant name)
   - Set `membership_type` from application `membership_category`
   - Set `membership_level_id` (lookup from category)
   - Set `dues_amount` from membership level
   - Set `membership_start_date` from application
   - Set `membership_expiration_date` from application
   - Set `application_status` = "Approved"
   - Set `approved_by` from application `reviewed_by`
   - Set `approved_date` from application `approved_date`
   - Set `active` = TRUE

2. **Create Individuals record for primary applicant:**
   - Generate `individual_id`
   - Set `household_id` (from new household)
   - Set `first_name`, `last_name` (parsed from application `primary_applicant_name`)
   - Set `email` from application `primary_applicant_email`
   - Set `relationship_to_primary` = "Primary"
   - Set `active` = TRUE

3. **If sponsorship required:**
   - Set Household `sponsor_name` from application
   - Set Household `sponsor_email` from application
   - Set Household `sponsor_verified` = TRUE (already verified in application)
   - Set Household `sponsor_verified_date` from application
   - Set Household `sponsor_verified_by` from application

4. **Update Membership Applications record:**
   - Set `household_id` (link back to new household)
   - Set `application_id` to "Approved" status is permanent

| **Tracking** | Generic queue | Complete application lifecycle |
| **Sponsorship** | Not tracked | Full sponsorship workflow |
| **Documents** | Generic file reference | Specific application form + supporting docs |

## Migration Path (If Existing Data)

If you have existing data in Pending Approvals:

1. **Export current data** as backup
2. **Filter out non-application items** (photos, documents, reservations)
   - Delete or archive those rows
   - They're now tracked in File Submissions or Reservations sheets
3. **Map remaining application records to new schema:**
   - `approval_id` → `application_id`
   - `item_id` → `application_id` (keep same)
   - `submitted_by` → `primary_applicant_email`
   - Add missing fields (primary_applicant_name, contact_phone, etc. from Households/Individuals)
   - Add application documents references if available
4. **Delete old Pending Approvals sheet**
5. **Create new Membership Applications sheet** with new schema

## Summary of Changes

✅ **Renamed:** Pending Approvals → Membership Applications  
✅ **Narrowed scope:** Applications only (not all approvals)  
✅ **Added fields:** Sponsorship tracking, document references, detailed review workflow  
✅ **Added relationships:** Links to Households, Individuals  
✅ **Improved audit trail:** Dates at each stage (submitted, assigned, reviewed, approved)
